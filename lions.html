                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
      <p>Lions are powerful carnivorous mammals found mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, 
        with a small population of Asiatic lions living in India's Gir Forest.
         Known as “the king of the jungle,” lions are the only cats that live in social groups called prides.
         A typical pride consists of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. 
         Male lions are easily recognized by their thick manes, which can vary in color and size.</p>
       <p>Lions are apex predators and hunt a variety of prey, including zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo.
         Females usually do most of the hunting, working together to ambush prey, while males defend the pride's territory. 
         Lions are most active at night and can sleep up to 20 hours a day. 
         Their deep roars can be heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away, serving as a warning or a way to find pride members. 
         Lions are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
