                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
      <p>The giant panda is a bear species native to the mountainous forests of central China. 
         Known for its distinctive black-and-white coloring, the giant panda is one of the most recognized and beloved animals in the world. 
         Adult pandas can weigh between 100 to 150 kilograms (220-330 pounds) and have a special wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help them grasp bamboo, their primary food source.</p>
       <p>Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas eat almost exclusively bambooâ€”up to 12 to 38 kilograms (26 to 84 pounds) per day. 
         They are solitary animals and spend most of their time eating or resting. 
         Pandas have a slow reproduction rate, and cubs are born extremely small and helpless, relying completely on their mothers. 
         Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas are considered vulnerable, but conservation efforts in China have helped increase their population in recent years.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
