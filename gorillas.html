                            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
      <p>Gorillas are the largest primates in the world and are native to the forests of central Africa.
         There are two main species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla.
         Gorillas are known for their strength, intelligence, and close genetic relationship to humans.
         Adult males, known as silverbacks, can weigh up to 180 kg (400 lb) and are responsible for protecting their group,
         which usually includes several females and young.</p>
       <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivores and eat a variety of fruits, leaves, stems, and shoots.
         They are highly social animals and communicate through facial expressions, vocalizations, and body gestures.
         Despite their intimidating size, gorillas are generally gentle and shy unless threatened. 
         They live in family groups and show deep bonds with one another, often seen grooming, playing, and comforting each other.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
