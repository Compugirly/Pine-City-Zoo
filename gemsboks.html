                            <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
      <p>Gemsbok, also known as the South African oryx,
         are large antelope found in the arid regions of southern Africa, 
         particularly in Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. 
         They are known for their striking appearance, 
         with grayish-brown coats, bold black-and-white facial markings, 
         and long, straight horns that both males and females possess.
         Gemsbok are perfectly adapted to desert lifeâ€”they can go long periods without drinking water, 
         getting the moisture they need from roots, bulbs, and desert melons.
          Their horns are used for protection and dominance, especially among males.</p>
       <p>These antelope are usually found in small herds of up to 30 animals and prefer open plains or dry savannah habitats.
         They are herbivores, feeding mainly on grasses and leaves, and are most active during the cooler parts of the day. 
         Gemsbok are powerful animals and can defend themselves against predators like lions. 
         Their ability to survive in extreme heat and scarcity of water makes them one of the most resilient animals in Africa.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
