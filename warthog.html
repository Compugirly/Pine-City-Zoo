                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
      <p>Warthogs are wild animals belonging to the pig family and are commonly found across sub-Saharan Africa.
         They typically inhabit grasslands, savannahs, and open woodlands where they can graze and dig for food. 
         Warthogs are known for their large curved tusks, flat faces, and the thick protective pads or “warts” on their cheeks. 
         These tusks are used for digging, self-defense, and fighting, especially among males. They often feed while kneeling on their front legs, which are protected by calloused pads.
          Warthogs have a distinctive appearance with a bristly mane and a thin tail that stands upright when they run.</p>
       <p>Unlike other wild pigs, warthogs are mostly active during the day and rely on their sharp sense of smell and hearing to detect predators. 
          They are omnivores, feeding mainly on grasses, roots, fruits, and occasionally insects or carrion.
           Warthogs often take shelter in burrows—usually abandoned ones made by aardvarks—which they enter backwards to defend themselves more easily.
          Despite their fierce look, they are generally shy and will flee if threatened. Warthogs can often be seen near waterholes and open plains, especially during the cooler parts of the day.</p>
