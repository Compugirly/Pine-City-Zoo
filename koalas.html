                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
      <p>Koalas are marsupials native to the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia. Although commonly called “koala bears,”
         they are not bears at all. Koalas have soft, gray fur, large ears, and strong limbs for climbing.
         They feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals.
         Koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to break down these leaves and extract moisture, so they rarely drink water.</p>
       <p>Koalas are mostly nocturnal and sleep for up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy, as their diet is low in nutrients.
          Females carry their young, called joeys, in a pouch for about six months.
         After that, the joey rides on its mother's back until it is ready to live independently.
         Koalas are currently facing threats due to habitat loss, climate change, and disease, and in some areas, they are considered endangered.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
