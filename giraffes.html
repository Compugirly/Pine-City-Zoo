                            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
      <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, 
         native to the savannahs and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa.
         Adult giraffes can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall,
         with their necks alone reaching about 2 meters (6 feet).
         They use this height advantage to reach leaves high in the trees, 
         particularly from acacia species, which make up a large part of their diet.
          Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern, which also helps with camouflage and temperature regulation.</p>
       <p> Giraffes live in loose social groups and communicate through body language and infrasonic sounds.
         Males sometimes engage in "necking," a behavior where they swing their necks to spar for dominance.
         Despite their size, giraffes are graceful and can run up to 60 km/h (37 mph).
         Their height and excellent eyesight also help them spot predators from far away. 
         Giraffes typically give birth standing up, and their calves can walk within a few hours of birth.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffe at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
