                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
      <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and social primates found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. 
         They are generally divided into two groups: New World monkeys (found in Central and South America) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia). 
         Most monkeys are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, and have prehensile tails or strong limbs that help them swing, climb, and leap between branches.</p>
       <p>Monkeys eat a wide range of foods, including fruits, nuts, insects, and leaves.
         Some species, like the capuchin monkey, are known for using tools to obtain food.
         Monkeys live in troops and have complex social structures, often using vocal calls, facial expressions, and grooming to communicate and build bonds. 
         Their playful nature, problem-solving skills, and adaptability make them fascinating animals to observe both in the wild and in zoos.</p>
